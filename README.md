# Hi there, I'm Julian👋  
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about turning data into actionable insights and deploying intelligent solutions at scale. I’ve built end-to-end ML pipelines, deployed models with Docker and REST APIs, and explored cutting-edge frameworks for NLP, Computer Vision, and LLMs.  

Currently, I’m focused on **data analysis, MLOps, and real-world deployment**, blending technical precision with authentic presentation.
